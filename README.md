# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is the source code of my personal web-site. It's built using Svelte and SvelteKit - a robust framework for building web applications.

From here I will share my experience on software development topics. I don't have comments yet. However you're free to open an issue if you found a mistake or want to discuss any article.

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the site:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
